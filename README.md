# Intuition-Net_Physics-based-Image-segmentation-outpainting
Intuition net is a neural network architecture which is built upon the idea of Object Permanance in humans which also leads us to understand physics and inertia of objects intuitively. The network in question will be able to predict segmentation mask for vehicles on road which are not part of the visual field from previous time step data.  

This our 8th semester final year project.
