# Intuition-Net_Physics-based-Image-segmentation-outpainting
Intuition net is a neural network + experiment which is built upon the idea of Object Permanance in humans which also leads us to understand physics and inertia of objects intuitively. The network in question will be able to predict segmentation mask for vehicles on road which are not part of the visual field from previous time step data.  

This is our 8th semester final year project and is intended for making a novel contribution in the study and research in Computer Vision and Deep Learning.
